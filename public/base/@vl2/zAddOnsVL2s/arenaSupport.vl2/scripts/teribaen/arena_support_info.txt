Arena Support (Version 1.0) - By Teribaen
--------------------------------------------------

This script adds clientside support for the Tribes 2 Arena gametype, including:

* ObjectiveHUD (HUD in the lower left)
* Console commands for admins

Possible future features:

* Support for voting/admin lobby options

This version is parallel with the 0.95 arena server and replaces both ArenaHUD versions (0.91 and 0.94d)


--------------------------------------------------
Admin Console Commands
--------------------------------------------------

These commands are entered into your client console (which must be enhanced by Arena Support) - not the server console

To use these commands you must have admin or super admin access (depending on the command)


arenaForceRoundEnd( # );
The current round will end and the game will advance to the next round
OPTIONAL: Specify the index of a team to win the round (ie: 1 or 2 )


arenaSetCurrentRoundLimit( # )
Changes the round limit to # - Effective Immediately
IMPORTANT: The change lasts only until the server changes maps
           
           
arenaSetCurrentTimeLimit( # ) - Requires Arena 0.95b+
Changes the time limit to # - Effective at the start of the next round
IMPORTANT: The change lasts only until the server changes maps
