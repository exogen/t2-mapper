Map Pack assembled by Celios (celios@teamwarfare.com) with many thanks to the original authors and those who helped with the testing. Special thanks to BaNsHee, j_thunders, Julius and the T2 Map Council for their help and suggestions.

This is the final version (2.0) of the map pack and is both approved and required for competitive play across TeamWarfare ladders. There are 23 new maps included here - most have been modified pretty significantly, some have barely been touched. The original terrain, interior and other clientside files have had their names preserved wherever possible to improve compatibility with previous versions of the maps. Thanks for downloading, and enjoy! :]
