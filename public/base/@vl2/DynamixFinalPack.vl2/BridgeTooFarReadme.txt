These final missions are a thank you from the Dynamix Tribes2 DEV team to you, the Tribes Players.
Thanks to you we were able to bring our dreams into reality.
These missions are not in a polished state, yet we hope you enjoy them.
There are a few rough edges, poly counts are high in some areas,
and we did not have the time to completely test these missions so please be kind in your reviews.
Thanks to Rod Fung, new producer of the Tribes Franchise, for approving the release of these maps.

Keep the dream alive,

Dynamix Tribes 2 DEV team
